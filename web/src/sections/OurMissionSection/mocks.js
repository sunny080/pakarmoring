Hence the armored passenger vehicle was introduced." The armored passenger vehicle industry is a relatively new industry from the standpoint of manufacturers dedicated to the science of armored vehicle conversion. Some of the earliest examples of such converted vehicles were owned by notorious individuals, like Bonnie and Clyde and AI Capone. The technology consisted of mounting heavy plates of steel (non-ballistic) and layered glass on the doors. Materials that did not change until the 1970\'s, though the mounting and installation techniques improved. While the first individuals who used armored cars were criminals and gave armored vehicle a "black eye| of sorts, eventually (1940\'s) this type of product found a place protecting presidents and heads of state. Harry S. Truman was the first US President to have an armored vehicle not considered mandatory until after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.',
